# VidSEO

VidSEO is a WordPress plugin that exposes video transcripts as **native HTML text surfaces** so language models and answer engines can read, retrieve, and quote video content safely.

VidSEO does not generate content. It does not summarize. It does not infer missing facts.  
Its role is **exposure**, not interpretation.
