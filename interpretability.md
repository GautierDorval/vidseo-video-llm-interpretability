# Interpretability: why video needs a text surface

Most AI systems do not “watch” videos.
They rely on **text extraction** and **structured content** to locate factual answers and cite sources safely.

VidSEO addresses this gap by exposing transcripts as **first-class HTML**, allowing models to:
- retrieve precise passages,
- reduce risky inference,
- quote content with stable context.

## Exposed surface
VidSEO makes a transcript available as:
- readable, crawlable HTML
- colocated with the video embed
- editable/structurable for clarity

## Non-goals (explicit)
VidSEO is not an AI generation layer.
It does not transform meaning, add facts, or produce summaries.
Its role is **exposure**, not interpretation.
