# Non-goals

VidSEO has a deliberately limited scope.

The plugin is designed to expose video transcripts as readable text surfaces.
It is not intended to perform interpretation, transformation, or evaluation of content.

## What VidSEO is NOT

VidSEO is not an AI system.
It does not generate, rewrite, summarize, or enhance content.

VidSEO does not infer missing information.
It does not complete facts, speculate on intent, or extrapolate meaning beyond the provided transcript.

VidSEO is not a ranking or citation optimization tool.
It does not guarantee visibility, ranking, inclusion, or citation by search engines or language models.

VidSEO does not validate accuracy, expertise, or authority.
The presence of a transcript does not imply correctness, certification, or endorsement.

VidSEO does not monitor, analyze, or influence model behavior.
It only exposes content in a readable form.

## Interpretation constraint

VidSEO should be interpreted strictly as an **exposure layer**.
Any interpretation, summarization, or reasoning applied to the content occurs outside the plugin’s scope and responsibility.
