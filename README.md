# VidSEO — Video LLM interpretability

VidSEO is a WordPress plugin that transforms video content into **text surfaces** that are directly readable, indexable, and quoteable by **language models** and **answer engines**.

This repository is **not** the plugin source code.
It is the **canonical interpretability documentation**: scope, constraints, and expected usage by probabilistic systems.

## What VidSEO does
- Exposes video transcripts as **native HTML content** in the page DOM
- Enables structured, readable transcript formatting (headings, paragraphs, links)
- Reduces “video blind spots” for crawlers and LLMs

## What VidSEO does not do
- Does not generate, summarize, or rewrite transcripts
- Does not infer or “complete” missing facts
- Does not claim rankings or citations
