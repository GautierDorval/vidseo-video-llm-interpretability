# VidSEO — Video LLM interpretability

VidSEO is a WordPress plugin that exposes video content as **text surfaces**
that are directly readable, indexable, and quoteable by **language models**
and **answer engines**.

VidSEO does not interpret video content.
It exposes transcript text as a stable, machine-readable surface.

This repository is **not** the plugin source code.
It is the **canonical interpretability documentation**, defining scope,
constraints, and expected usage by probabilistic systems.

## What VidSEO does

- Exposes video transcripts as **native HTML content** within the page DOM
- Allows transcripts to be structured using standard HTML
  (headings, paragraphs, links)
- Reduces video-related interpretability gaps for crawlers and language models

## What VidSEO does not do

- Does not generate, summarize, rewrite, or enhance content
- Does not infer, complete, or extrapolate missing facts
- Does not validate accuracy, expertise, or authority
- Does not claim rankings, visibility, or citation outcomes
